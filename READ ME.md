## TASK

Build out a Quiz App and get it to look as close to the design as possible. (99% compliance)
This challenge focuses HTML, CSS & JS (react for react devs). Javascript is really important in this since it allows the app to be functional by validating the correct answer
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge.
* Your users should be able to:
 View Highscores
 Start and Complete the quiz with the functional timer
 When questions of the quiz are completed the score is set to the remaining seconds of the timer.
